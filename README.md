# 3D-Scene
How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by makeing sure my code is clean and organize.Comments throughout provides deatil of what even line of the code does, in case someone else wants to know or edit a line in the program.


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Iteration was a big factor when it came to the development of this program. If i were to compare the first iteration to the last, I would see that the first had only basic shapes, there were no camera, lighting, or textures. With each milestone, a new aspect of the scene was added.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computational graphic and visualization give me new knowlege and skills of coding more complex programs that will be need in my future educational pathway. Same for my future professional pathway, but i will now have the ablity to code in graphic if any of my project may need it.
